Weâ€™re excited to announce the Global Digital Humanities Symposium at Michigan State University on March 16-17, 2017.

This two-day symposium will address how the interdisciplinary practices of digital humanities can and should speak to the global cultural record and the contemporary situation of our planet.

Mark March 16 and 17 down in your calendar and look out for more information about the symposium at the beginning of spring semester 2017.
